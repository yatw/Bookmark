# Bookmark

A full-stack web app to store and organize useful information for future reference


## About the project

#### Ambition

Sometime you stumble upon a really great article, a good tutorial, or an excellent piece of advice. You could store it in your browser's bookmark, but it stops being useful after 20 links or so.

There are many bookmark managers out there, but I wanted one that is free, reliable and customized, so I will make one myself.

#### How to use

This is a web app mainly for myself. I could simply paste in the url and click save to add the bookmark in database. Visitors can search and browse my collections.


#### Technologies

The frontend is done in **React**, with casual **Bootstrap** and **CSS**

The backend is written in **Node.js** with **Express** to handle client requests.

The database used is **MySQL**

The language used is **JavaScript**


#### Status

The project is ongoing and not yet hosted.
